    "Upload general dataset CSV into pandas (must be saved in same folder as this notebook) and convert it into a DataFrame. This stage requires that you have already run the first notebook, and gone through the process of categorising charges in the Google Sheet and used an array formula to assess the Charge (s) column for the different types of charges and put either 'Contains' or 'Doesn't Contain' in the columns where there is a match. E.g. if you have a tab with Violent Charges and it contains the charge 'Battery', then if the array formula finds the word 'Battery' in the Charge (s) column for a given row, it will enter 'Contains' in the Violent Charges column"
