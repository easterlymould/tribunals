    "This notebook takes the general dataset of court martials (or an edited version with just the relevant columns), after it has been cleaned with the first notebook + extra manual cleaning in Google Sheets using array formulas and the like to create columns that assess the Charge (s) column for each type of charge. It also requires that you have gone through the Violent Charges column and Sexual Offence charges column and marked in new columns whether they were found guilty of those offences. This is currently a lot of manual work, hopefully I will find a more efficient way to do all of this at some point! \n",
